# BitRound
Dapp for funding Rounds
# Abstract
The work aims to develop a web platform where investors and entrepreneurs can conduct company financing rounds. Blockchain technology and Smart contracts will provide decentralized, public, and secure network management for the platform's development. Blockchain technology reduces the costs of third parties managing the financing rounds and gives anonymous, truthful, and transparent information accessible to everyone. This work aims to create a platform for everyone to use and improve business fiduciary relationships.

# Introduction
We live in a capitalist world in constant evolution and development due to technology. Currently, it is easier than ever to create and destroy wealth; the average time and capital to create a company have plummeted. The evolution of technology in the past 20 years has made it easier to register a business online, intercommunicate with the world with almost no costs, operate without a physical location, and the entrepreneur community is growing fast. All these changes have led to a growth in the creation of start-ups in every country.

Traditional funding rounds are lengthy and costly, with complex processes and limited access to small investors. Entrepreneurs seek rapid investment to enter a competitive market where time is crucial to success. Blockchain is a transparent, anonymous, and reliable technology that helps us to solve many of the current problems in start-up funding. 

This final project aims to explore the use of blockchain in funding rounds, especially in implementing the technology in the early stages of a company where access to a broader pool of investors and reduced costs is critical. This work will also explore ways to solve fundamental investment issues through smart contracts that secure investment. Additionally, the project will determine the potential for blockchain to democratize the network for small investors and other benefits of using Blockchain networks.
